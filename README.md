# Robo-Wars
The first (experimental) game I made on Unity

This game was purely made with the intent to practice and train my knowledge regarding game development.
I finished the game when I was about 16 and left it to gather dust, but I later(now) realized I should keep it somewhere to remind me how far I had come and where I had started. 
I did add some tweaks to make the game a bit more playable (brighter, quieter, easier) but still kept all else, including any glitches I didn't find, so to keep the game in the condidition I found it in. Rather I could have kept updating the game for as long as I lived, adding more and more things as time would go on, but everything must end, and so it has for my first published game on Unity.
